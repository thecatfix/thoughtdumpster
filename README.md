<h1> Welcome to the thoughtdumpster</h1>

<h2> This is the repository that will keep you up at night as I try to  prove my work from online classes.</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>
I am going to attempt to keep track of some experiments/homework/wtfamidoing in this repository.<br>
As of Nov 2 2023 I have the skills of a 5th grader for writing html and I really fcking hate all things git.However, I need to learn why version control is important and how to use it.</p>
<br>
  <strong>Warning this might be a few entries but I am going to attempt to have some semblence of my work.</strong>
<em>btw i did the warning b/c i learned what a strong tag was last night!!!</em>
