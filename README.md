<h1> Welcome to the thoughtdumpster</h1>

<h2> This is the repository that will keep you up at night as I try to  prove my work from online classes.</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>
I am going to attempt to keep track of some experiments/homework/wtfamidoing in this repository.<br>
As of Nov 2 2023 I have the skills of a 5th grader for writing html. However, I need to learn why version control is important and how to use it.</p>
<br>

# Update 12/23/2023 - Thanks YOU [Gautam krishna R](https://github.com/gautamkrishnar)! 
## His page gives you great ideas for your README page that force you to learn version control
