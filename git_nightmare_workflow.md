My comments on my first commit and pull request from the GitHub Desktop tutorial #private repository

Okay so the order for my  disaster of a workflow is the following:
Create a branch that is not the production (GitHub calls it Main or that is standard???)

I created rough_draft (aka "dev" in nerdspeak).
rough_draft took the readme.md file that I had in main and let me make edits.

Then i made what is called a commit. Is that a commitment to something? WTF does it mean? I am committing the file to some higher source or is this using the word commit like boyfriend / girlfriend speak.

Then I publish from my desktop tot Github webpage.

So I made the commitment and I am done right......WRONG

I had to create a pull request and this is where this gets confusing AF.

The pull request will merge the rough_draft version of the file into the main branch.

This is the point where you want to have someone review the version of the file that is being committed. But here is the fckd up thing to me....is this file even deployed to an environment that shows up anywhere???? Don't you have to package all of this nonsense into a package and then deploy it?

Think about that!
