 <h3>Prompt 1: What Is TypeORM?</h3>
<body>
  <p>
<strong>TypeORM is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for TypeScript and JavaScript that simplifies database interactions in web applications. It is particularly popular in the Node.js ecosystem and is often used with TypeScript. TypeORM allows developers to work with databases using object-oriented programming principles, making it easier to manage database operations, define database schema, and perform queries.</strong><br>

  <br><strong>Here are some key features and aspects of TypeORM:</strong><br>
    </p>
<br><strong>Language Support:</strong>  TypeORM is designed to work with TypeScript and JavaScript, providing strong typing and code completion support when using TypeScript. This makes it a preferred choice for developers who want to build type-safe applications.
<br>
  <br><strong>Multiple Database Support:</strong> TypeORM supports a variety of relational databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server. This flexibility allows developers to choose the database that best suits their project requirements.<br>

  <br><strong> Entity-Relationship Mapping:</strong> TypeORM enables developers to define database entities using TypeScript classes. These classes represent database tables, and their properties correspond to table columns. This simplifies the process of defining and maintaining the database schema.<br>

  <br><strong>Query Builder and Repository:</strong> TypeORM provides a powerful query builder and a repository pattern for performing database operations. Developers can create complex queries using a fluent and type-safe API, making it easier to retrieve and manipulate data.<br>

  <br><strong>Migrations:</strong> TypeORM supports database migrations, allowing developers to manage changes to the database schema over time. This helps in maintaining database consistency across different versions of the application.<br>

  <br><strong>Middleware and Lifecycle Events:</strong> TypeORM allows developers to define middleware and lifecycle events, which can be used for tasks such as validation, data transformation, and logging.<br>

  <br><strong>Integration with Express and NestJS:</strong> TypeORM can be seamlessly integrated with popular Node.js frameworks like Express and NestJS, making it a suitable choice for building web applications.<br>

  <br><strong>Active Community:</strong>TypeORM has an active and growing community, which means it receives regular updates, bug fixes, and new features.<br>

  <br><em>In summary, TypeORM is a versatile ORM library that simplifies database interactions in TypeScript and JavaScript applications. It offers strong typing, support for multiple databases, and a range of features that make it a popular choice for both frontend and backend developers working on web applications.</em><br>

   <h3>Prompt 2: Act as a tech stack expert. You will be proficient in front end technologies, backend technologies and API tools in the market. You will provide easy to understand explanations of the technology and the fundamental concepts. Your explanations will be crafted to an audience of non developers that have a bit of understanding of coding but do not develop code. My first question is what is typeorm?</h3></p>

      <strong>Certainly! Here's a simplified explanation:

      Imagine your database as a giant electronic filing cabinet with lots of drawers and folders. Each drawer holds specific information, and you need a way to organize and retrieve data from these drawers efficiently. That's where TypeORM comes in.

      TypeORM acts like an expert librarian for your database, helping you:</strong>
<p> 
 
      </p>
  <br><strong>1. Define Data Models:</strong> You can describe the structure of your data (like tables in a spreadsheet) using TypeScript or JavaScript classes. These classes represent tables in your database and define what kind of data can be stored in each table.TypeORM is designed to work with TypeScript and JavaScript, providing strong typing and code completion support when using TypeScript. This makes it a preferred choice for developers who want to build type-safe applications.
  <br>
    <br><strong>2. Perform Database Operations:</strong> TypeORM provides a set of easy-to-use methods and queries that allow your application to interact with the database seamlessly. It can handle tasks like creating, reading, updating, and deleting data in a structured way.
<br>

    <br><strong>3. Mapping Data:</strong> TypeORM maps the data in your code (objects and classes) to the data in your database tables, so you can work with them more easily. <br>

    <br><strong>4. Database Synchronization:</strong> It can even help you automatically generate database tables based on your defined data models. This means you don't have to manually create tables; TypeORM can do it for you.<br>


    <br><em>In summary, TypeORM simplifies the process of working with databases, making it easier for developers to create, manage, and access data without getting bogged down in complex database queries and operations. It's a valuable tool for backend developers who want to build efficient and maintainable database-driven applications.</em><br>
